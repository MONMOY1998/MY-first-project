# In this programme I will calculate the neutron star mass and radius by solving the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff equations $:$
# 
# $\frac{dp}{dr}=-\frac{Gm(r)\epsilon(r)}{r^2c^2}\left(1+\frac{p(r)}{\epsilon(r)}\right)\left(1+\frac{4\pi r^3p(r)}{m(r)c^2}\right)\left(1-\frac{2Gm(r)}{rc^2}\right)^{-1}$
# 
# $\frac{dm}{dr}=\frac{4\pi r^2 \epsilon(r)}{c^2}$
# 
# To solve this equation we will write the rhs of this TOV Equations in rescale units $:$ energy  density and pressure are in units of $GeV/fm^3.$We write mass in units of solar mass $M_{solar}=2 \times 10^{30}$ kg and radius in units of Schwarzschild radius $R_s=\frac{2GM_{solar}}{c^2}=2.95$ km and a quantity $\alpha$ is defined as $\alpha=\frac{M_{solar}c^2}{R_s^3}=41.325$ in units of $\frac{GeV}{fm^3}$
# 
# Then the formula will take the form $:$
# 
# $\frac{dp}{dx}=-\frac{0.5\times \bar{m} \left(1+\frac{p}{\epsilon}\right) \left(1+\frac{4 \pi p}{\alpha \bar{m}}\right)}{(x^2-\bar{m}x)}$
# 
# $\frac{dm}{dx}=\frac{4 \pi x^2 \epsilon}{\alpha}$
# 
# Here $\bar{m}$ is mass in units of solar mass and $x$ is  the radial distance in units of Schwarzchild radius.
# 
# Here we will use a simple equation of state for a non-interacting gas of neutrons.The equation of state is specified through a simple  numerical fitting formula $:$
#     
# $\epsilon(p)= a_{nr}p^{\frac{3}{5}}+a_r p$ where $a_{nr}$ and $a_{r}$ are constants we have to choose properly.

# Here we have defined a function called $"tovrhs"$ that takes two parameters $:$ $"initial$" and $"x"$. This function calculates the right-hand side $(RHS)$ of the Tolman-Oppenheimer-Volkoff $(TOV)$ equations.Assuming $'initial'$ is a list like object we have assigned first element of this list to the $"p"$ variable and second element of the list to the $"m"$ variable.
# Then we have called a function $"eos"$ with $"p"$  variable as an argument and assigned the returned value to the variable $"ùúñ"$.It calculates the energy density based on the given pressure.Then we have assigned the components of rhs of the $"TOV"$ equations by $"one"$ and $"two"$ and the calculated values of $"one"$ and $"two"$ are stored in a list $"f"$ which is returned as the output of the $"tovrhs"$ function.

#  Below we have defined a function $eos$ which has taken a parameter $p$ representing pressure. Then we have assigned the values to the coefficients $a_{nr}$ and $a_r$.These values are coefficients used in a fit to the non-interacting neutron matter pressure.
# Then a conditional statement is used to handle the case where given pressure is non-negative.It sets a small positive pressure value $10^{-8}$ $GeV/fm^3$ to avoid undefined behaviour that could occur when using non-positive value.
# The last line calculated the equation of state value and the calculated value is returned as the output of the function.
# 
# In summary the function $eos$ has taken a pressure value as an input . If pressure is non-negative it sets a very small value if necessary,Then it calculated the equation of state using the given pressure and returned the result.

# In below a function $tsolve$ is called with two arguments $p0$ and $xfinal$ representing central pressure and final value of the independent variable respectively.

# Then the function $eos$ is called with central pressure as an argument and the returned value is assigned to the variable $ùúñ$.It calculates the energy density based on the given central preesure.
# 
# $dx$ represents the step size in the independent variable $x$ and is used for numerical integration.
#

# 
# Now an array x is created which represents the values of the independent variable over which the differential equations will be solved.

They are used to store values related to some physical quantities.By setting it zero initially,it ensures that variables are initialized before any calculations or updates are performed.$"rstar"$  and  $"mstar"$ represent final value of radial distance or radius and mass respectively i.e., the radial distance and at last iteration of the loop.
# 
# Next, three empty lists $"m"$,$"r"$,$"p"$ are created to store updated values of $"rstar"$,$"mstar"$ and pressure$("i")$ during the  each loop iteration.
# 
# Now,a loop is started that iterates over the values in the first column $([:,0])$ of $"tov_sol"$ array.Each value represents a pressure at a particular iteration.
# 
# Then if the pressure $"i"$ is greater than $10^{-7}$,the $"count"$ variable  is incremented by $1$, the values of $"rstar"$ and $"mstar"$ are updated and then appended to the the $"r"$ and $"m"$ list respectively.Finally, it appends the current value of pressure to the $"p"$ list.
# 
# $"count"$ serves as a counter variable that keeps track of the number of iterations or steps in which the pressure $"i"$ is greater than $1.e-7$. It is used to access and store specific values related to the $ mass (mstar)$ from the $tov_sol$ array.
# 
# Then fuction $tsolve$ returns the final values of the radial distance $"(rstar)"$and mass $"(mstar)"$ as well as the lists $"r"$, $"m"$, and $"p"$, which contain the updated values of the radial distance, mass, and pressure at each iteration of the loop as output of it as a tuple.
